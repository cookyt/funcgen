# funcgen
Simple Audio Function Generator

## Roadmap

- Prevent the screen from sleeping when sound is playing.
- Put the panel into a web-component and allow multiple instances (so we can
  play multiple functions at once).
- White noise function.
- Volume Slider
- L/R Pan Slider
- Global control panel
- Icons for the function types.

## Maybe?

- Use Canvas to manually draw an arbitrary waveform?
